# God (from the movie Bruce Almighty)

What shall I tell you about god? He is the almighty and you can read The Bible to lern more about him.
In the movie Bruce Almighty he plays a special role, but I won't spoil anything. So you need to watch the movie yourself.

## Character traits

* Good
* Almighty
* Wise

As god once said:

> Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce. It's a magic trick. A single mom who's working two jobs and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle. A teenager who says "no" to drugs and "yes" to an education, that's a miracle. People want me to do everything for them. But what they don't realize is *they* have the power. You want to see a miracle, son? Be the miracle.
